# Note Taker

## Description
For this challenge it was my job to add to existing starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.. My job was to write the get and post endpoints for the note taking app and deploy the finished product to Heroku.
